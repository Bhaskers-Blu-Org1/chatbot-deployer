# Chatbot Deployer

To be used in the new Bot Asset Exchange program.

## How it works

By hitting ``https://console.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy`` with three arguments:

1. URL escaped repository link, for example ``repository=https%3A//github.com/IBM/chatbot-deployer``
2. Bot Name, for example ``chatbotName=myCoolBot``
3. Workspace URL, for example: ``chatbotWorkspaceURL=https%3A//github.com/IBM/chatbot-deployer/raw/master/tmp/workspace.json``

See this link for a full example:
<a href="https://console.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https%3A//github.com/IBM/chatbot-deployer&chatbotName=Chatbot&chatbotWorkspaceURL=https%3A//github.com/IBM/chatbot-deployer/raw/master/tmp/workspace.json">test deploy</a>
